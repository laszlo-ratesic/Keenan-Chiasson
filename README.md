## Description
This repository contains the application code for my personal project portfolio. I began designing this portfolio as part of the UT Austin Full-Stack Coding Boot Camp where I was tasked with the challenge of creating a mobile responsive portfolio using advanced CSS techniques. This portfolio provides viewers information about me, links to other projects I've created, and links to contact me. üìê

Throughout the creation of this project I learned a great deal about CSS and how to manipulate my HTML in a huge variety of ways. To keep up with all of the CSS deployed throughout the project, and to help with processing time, the stylesheets are written using SCSS (also known as Sass or Sassy CSS). I chose to use SassScript because it allowed me to nest selectors inside one another and use indented syntax to allow for cleaner, shorter code. I also chose Sass because of its properties as a preprocessor. I use multiple stylesheets throughout the project and Sass allows me to interpret the numerous sheets into a singularly compiled stylesheet. I derived great enjoyment from the flexibility and utility that Sass has to offer, and I'm thankful to this project for leading me to this technology. üìú

I also began working heavily with SVG files and the CSS animation property as well as keyframes. The use of pseudo-elements and -selectors in conjunction with the transform property allowed for some pretty fun UX capabilities without the need for JavaScript, as seen with elements like my avatar, the app cards, and the svg icons in the contact section. I hope to continue my learning journey by learning more about SVG and animation used alongside JavaScript. üöÄ

## Installation
Locate the dropdown menu labeled 'Code' to the left of the About section in the main page of this repository. From there, select your preferred cloning method from HTTPS, SSH, or the GitHub CLI. For this demonstration, we will be using the SSH method. Copy the link and head to your terminal. From the command line you should enter:

    git clone <INSERT_SSH_KEY_HERE>

Replacing the above placeholder with the link copied from GitHub. This will clone the repository into a local directory on your machine. And that's it! Happy Hacking! üöÄ

## Usage
This code is strictly for use as Keenan Chiasson's Portfolio Page and is only provided as material for study and otherwise double-checking implementation of mobile-responsiveness and SCSS experimentation. Screenshots of original mockup are included.
